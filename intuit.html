			<h1>Product Design Internship at Intuit</h1>
		</div>
		<p>In summer 2022, I worked as a Product Design Intern at Intuit’s AI+Data team. During the 12 weeks, I worked on creating an AI cost management dashboard for AI leaders at Intuit.</p>
		<div>
			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>
				Managing cost of projects matters to organizations because they can know if they need to optimize and save resources. There was an existing cost dashboard for AI+Data organization, but it was underutilized.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<p>
				Before diving into the project, I met different stakeholders to ask about cost management to understand the context and see what’s the real problem.
				As I talked to them, I learned that the value of cost management is different depending on the user. Among team leaders and individual contributors, contributors were not conscious about their projects' cost while leaders were getting notified regularly on their spendings to keep under budget. And with this notifying process, it was somewhat mannual, and the budget owner marks the cost on spreadsheet and alert each leader on slack.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Takeaways</h2>
			<p>
				The PM for Cost reaches out to teams to understand why the cost is high or ask them to optimize their cost.<br>
				Some usability issues: “It’s not always consistent. It’s not always taking you to the same process.”<br>
				Need for creating insights automatically: “something I should look into”, “waste or savings opportunities (in other dashboard)”<br>
				The needs of contributors and leaders would be different: At this stage, the user group that needs cost information now is leaders.
