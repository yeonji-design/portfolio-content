				Currently studying HCI, UX Design and Research at the University of Michigan - School of Information.
				Previously worked as a Product Design Intern at Intuit.<br>
				Utilizing my knowledge and experience in complex technology, I wish to make them more accessible to people. With this passion, I've worked on multiple projects and products including Grasp, where I designed and tested a tool that helps people learn about machine learning and build it by themselves to bridge the gap between people and technology. Also, when I worked as a product manager at a startup, I created an online video interview solution that supports a soft transition from on-site interviews to virtual. Studying at the University of Michigan, Iâ€™m continuously looking for opportunities to deliver my passion as a designer.
